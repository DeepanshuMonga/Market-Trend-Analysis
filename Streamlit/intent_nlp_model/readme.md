## Intent NLP Model Artifacts

This directory contains tokenizer and configuration files used for the
intent classification component of the project.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, large trained model files
(e.g. `.safetensors`) are not included in this repository.

Optional:
The model weights can be downloaded from the link below for running
the Streamlit frontend locally:

The main notebook (`market_trend_analysis.ipynb`) remains the primary
source of truth for model training, evaluation, and analysis.
